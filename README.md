# MarkdownDoclet
Experiment with Javadoc Doclet which writes markdown instead of html

# Notes
This is still a personal project, though the output at 
http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/~jbf/autoplot/doc/ is already useful for 
Jython editors.  Presently this is hacked a bit for running on nudnik,
where it writes its output to /home/jbf/public_html/autoplot/doc.
Its markdown output is to /home/jbf/project/rbsp/git/autoplot/doc or
https://git.uiowa.edu/jbf/autoplot/-/blob/master/doc/
