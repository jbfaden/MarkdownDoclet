        <div>This is a custom Java Doclet which creates a simplified HTML 
            of the JavaDoc, which is effective in the Autoplot Jython editor
            popup.  This also creates a MarkDown version of the Javadoc, where
        the idea is that the community could help curate documentation.</div>
